        <description>Why have I been inactive on Youtube Clarification There are multiple reasons why I am inactive on YouTube. I would like to clarify that it does not mean I will never be posting a video. It just means that the upload rate is slow. I used to upload videos within once or twice per week.
Real life things School is what slows down my upload rate. Paying attention to classes is required to know what I will be learning for my career.</description>
