      <description>My busy days are over for a month. I do not have to finish important things that would slow my leisure activities down. I will be able to write more posts for this website. In addition, I could also learn more to know how to program. I will also be able to publish some videos and shorts to boost my channel&amp;rsquo;s subscribers.
While work is essential for needs and profit, leisure is also necessary as a guy can be tired of working.</description>

      <description>Why have I been inactive on Youtube Clarification There are multiple reasons why I am inactive on YouTube. I would like to clarify that it does not mean I will never be posting a video. It just means that the upload rate is slow. I used to upload videos within once or twice per week. One video per month is also possible.
Real life imports School is what slows down my upload rate.</description>
