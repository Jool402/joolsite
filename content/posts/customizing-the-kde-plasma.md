A couple or three days ago, I recustomized the KDE desktop environment. While customizing the desktop environment, I remembered that back in 2021, I found a sci-fi-looking theme that would nicely fit with my KDE setup. I briefly used it in 2021, but I will be using it much longer on my new setups (new meaning two and three years old computers).

Here's a little story, I was running Arch Linux on the old desktop that ran an Athlon 64 processor (I cannot remember the exact generation of this CPU, but it was somewhere around 3xxx or 2xxx), 2GB RAM, and Windows XP preinstalled. I had to make changes to the computer internals by replacing the GPU since it didn't have HDMI and it only had 256MB VRAM. I have not swapped other computer components. I also changed the Windows XP operating system to Arch Linux because Microsoft has stopped supporting Windows XP.

I started with LXDE, then I went up to XFCE all the way even to GNOME. GNOME freezes on this desktop sometimes. I even experimented with different tiling managers.

I used Lyra Blue KDE theme for only a brief period of time though. I experimented with other themes that work with KDE. One of the notable candy-looking theme I found is []. I set that theme before I went with Lyra Blue

Therefore, I was not only a distro hopper, but a DE hopper, and a theme hopper. 

Back on topic, I booted up Fedora to launch system configuration program on KDE. I went to appearances with steps to get to the KDE theme download manager. Then I searched up Lyra Blue and I set the Lyra Blue themes as default themes for every aspect of KDE and SDDM display manager.
