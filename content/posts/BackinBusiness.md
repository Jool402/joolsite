My busy days are over for one month. I do not have to finish a lot of important things that slow my leisure activity down. I will be able to write more posts for this website. In addition, I could also learn more to know how to program. I will also be able to publish some videos and shorts to boost my channel's subscribers.

## How did it feel to be free?
I felt joyful. The aura of freedom exists, knocking down the confinement of business and boredom. I love the feeling of freedom. Being bored and busy can knock me down especially when I had a lot to do. To compensate with the knocked down feeling, one would have to relax and maybe do hobbies which one enjoys. I will be able to relax and/or do stuff that I personally enjoy.

## How many more posts will I make?
It depends on my motivation. The best that I can do is 1 post per day. Sometimes, I feel quite motivated to write a post about something I would like to talk about. It is possible to write two posts per day if I feel extremely motivated. There are times when I do not feel like writing about anything. I can understand why there is a reason (or are reasons) to not write an article for today.

Some bloggers can do more posts per day and other bloggers can do less posts per day. It depends on their motivation, willingness, and hobby. Some also blog for a company whether independently and/or dependently. To clarify, independence means to blog in a company's blog website rather than in social media. It is possible that the company where a blogger works for assigns a minimum number of posts and words.

## How did I write posts?
I write down my posts using Markdown as [HUGO](https://gohugo.io) supports Markdown. Hugo empowers my website using (INSERT THEME). I did not have to write an HTML, the HUGO configuration file does some of the scripting and theming for me.

I recommend HUGO for anyone who chooses to blog independently without having to write HTML, HUGO is far better than WordPress to create sites if a blogger knows how to write Markdown and configure websites with TOML (AKA Tom's Obvious Minimal Language). Setting up HUGO can be complicated for a newcomer as it requires some command line knowledge.

I could also set my time to write posts instead of boring myself with laziness. Laziness is a boring state coming from a somewhat lazy person.

## Who do I program with?
Usually, I program by myself when it is personal, but I also work with ShadowCat to code miscellaneous programs on [Replit.com](https://replit.com).

I believe collaboration speeds coding up to reduce program release date. Collaboration also increases knowledge by sharing details of code about how the code snippet works. 

## How many more videos will I publish?
I may not candidly publish a lot of videos. Videos can be a hassle to make especially if the video is planned to be long.

I will publish more shorts than videos. Shorts are easier to produce than a typical video that lasts for minutes.

## Conclusion
With all the things I do listed above, I am also getting a break that relaxes me from confinement of boredom. The confinement of boredom traps me from enjoyment, but it lets me to do things that are necessary. It means that boredom is squashed a little, but it means that
