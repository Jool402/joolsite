## Why have I been inactive on Youtube

### Clarification
There are multiple reasons why I am inactive on YouTube. I would like to clarify that it does not mean I will never be posting a video. It just means that the upload rate is slow. I used to upload videos within once or twice per week. 

### Real life things
School is what slows down my upload rate. Paying attention to classes is required to know what I will be learning for my career. It slows down my rate of posting videos. In addition, classes give out homework, quizzes, tests, etc. to do. These important tasks cause further delay video uploads. It needs to be slowed down for my future and prosperity.

### Disinterest
This can happen to a lot of people who do not feel interested in publishing content. Publishing content can be a discouragement when demand for quantity of content is high. With the higher demand, the content needs to be published with higher endurence.
