## Welcome to JoolSite!

Jool is an author of this site. He is a college man in real life. He likes astronomy, computers, languages, and geography. He plays Kerbal Space Program and SuperTuxKart. He also uploads videos too, but the rate of uploads is slowing down. He has some social media sites that are listed in the upper right corner.

He is on video social media sites including YouTube, Rumble, and Odysee. He plans to have a Twitch account, but he doesn't do a lot of livestreams---he also keeps deleting a Twitch account everytime he creates one.

He can read comments in some of these languages listed below. But it is possible that he can misunderestand what the commenter said due to language barrier.

He speaks English, Spanish, and French, but he learns a lot more. He learns Greek, Portuguese, Italian, etc. He doesn't officially speak these languages but he could understand an idea of what the people are saying. He can write these languages to a certain extent.

He is not fan of writing, but he still writes some papers including the website.

He does know how to code. Knowing C/C++, Python, Javascript, and Rust, he collaborates with Cocoa Project, but his creativity is too low for much creativity. Therefore cannot go pass the Hello World. It shows how important creativity is for programming. Collaboration also covers for low creativity as they can share ideas.
