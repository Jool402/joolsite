## Welcome to Kerbsite!

### Let's introduce Jool!
Jool is an author of this site. He is a college man in real life. He likes astronomy, computers, languages, and geography. He plays Kerbal Space Program, Endless Sky, and SuperTuxKart. He also uploads videos too, but the rate that he uploads is slowing down. He has some social media sites that are listed in social media links and usernames.

He is on video social media sites including YouTube, Twitch, Rumble, and Odysee.

#### Languages

He speaks English, Spanish, and French, but he learns a lot more. He learns Greek, Portuguese, Italian, Chinese, etc. He doesn't officially speak these languages but he could understand an idea of what the people are saying. He can write these languages to a certain extent.

#### Productivity

He is not a fan of writing, but he still writes some papers including the website.

He does know how to read code. Knowing C/C++, Python, Javascript, and Rust, he collaborates with Cocoa Project, but his creativity is too low and time is too constrained for him to code much. Therefore he cannot go far pass the Hello World. It shows how important time and creativity is for programming. Collaboration helps.
